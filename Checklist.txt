To Do:
	Blacktree:
		
	Waterseal:
		- Fix the module look.

Done:
	Waterseal:
		- Looking into Leon's attempt at header styling. Want the headers to be styled like the Waterseal logo.
		- The creation metadata on each page will need to be hidden somehow. Example: 'August 28, 2017 by watersealadmin'.
		- Add the background image pipe style between to the two pipe sections.
		
Decomposition:
	Blacktree:
			- Removed unecessary pages from menu items.
			- Haven't hidden the logo when the screen reduces, as it doesn't look so bad with the reduced menu items.
			- Moved the 'Contact Us' link to second from the left. Also rearranged some of the order of the footer items.
			- Increased the footer padding.
