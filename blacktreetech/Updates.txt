17-Aug-2017 Meeting:
Updates:
	- Menu items have been moved to the left.
	- The top logo's padding has been reduced. 
	- The overall website margins have been reduced.
	- The blurb text's title has been bolded.
	- Menu items have been bolded.
	- Calender text colour has been made white + decided to make the 'CONTACT US' text white also.
	- Removed sub menu services in the footer area (via display:none;).
	- Changed the background. Made it more transparent, while covering the whole page.
	- Fixed the background issue displaying weirdly on different pages.
	- Sort of fixed the offset on the 'Page scroll to ID' plugin. It is loosely based on the height of the header (125px).
	- Changed the padding on the top blurb.
	- The front page images are all the same size.
Notes:
	- Is it possible to have a widget in the header? For the language bar purposes.
