                <h3>Below Grade Structure</h3>
                <p>By waterproofing the elements of a building or structure below the grade line or floor level it ensures that the foundation maintains it structural integrity. A common cause of foundation problems is when the soil underneath the foundation is wet, which results in shifts as the water evaporates. This is why we recommend our product as the perfect solution to your below grade waterproofing needs.</p>

                <h3>Suspended Slab</h3>
                <p>If your slab has anything important underneath it, or you want it to be weather proof, subsequently increasing its durability and life span. Without waterproofing the slab, especially a suspended slab you run the risk of water or moisture seeping through and damaging the structural integrity of the slab itself, as well as the surrounding structure. Make sure you get your slab waterproofed today by our specialists and have peace of mind that your slab won’t be leaking in the winter months.</p>
